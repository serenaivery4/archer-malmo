		<h1>Eat With Us</h1>

		<p>After an amazing tour of Archer Malmo we refueled our bodies at <span>CookOut</span></p>

		<p class="image-wrap">The line was super long but the employees worked really hard to get the food orders out quickly and correctly. I was warned that the Milkshake would be thick but I didnâ€™t expect it to be that thick. I had to get up from my table to get a spoon and some napkins. But it was worth every scoop. </p>

		<p>I ordered an <span>Oreo Milkshake</span> and <span>French Fries</span></p>
